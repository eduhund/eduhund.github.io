Your clients or users use instant messengers (WhatsApp, Skype, LINE, WeChat, Viber, Snapchat, Telegram and others) to send messages, and you conduct a dialogue using a separate Slack channel. You can add as many users as you like to a Slack channel. Either one person or a whole group of specialists can respond to messages from users/clients.

## Origin 
Initially, the idea to create such an assistant bot appeared when we realized that it was difficult for us to collect feedback from people who studied on our [Taskbook] (https://eduhund.gumroad.com/l/bosses?_gl=1*19igkme*_ga*MjA0NjQzODgwMS4xNzEyMjk5MjUw*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTcxMzM0MTk2Mi40LjEuMTcxMzM0MzU5OS4wLjAuMA) on Google Sheets. Students wrote comments/questions/problems in a special comment (notes) field.

All these messages were collected in a separate Google table. We could see them only if we specifically came to see what was happening there.

## Problems we faced: 

- We could not give quality feedback in time
- We lost messages/bugs/questions/feedback (especially technical ones, if  something doesn’t work/doesn’t open/something is broken)
- People don't like to write emails. mail is a last resort

There were attempts to create a community in telegram. This solution also had its problems, firstly, because it requires high involvement from us (communication with people), and secondly, communication takes place in public. Many people are embarrassed by this format of communication. Few people are ready to communicate in a public field, just like one on one. People have a fear of appearing stupid or a fear of asking an inappropriate question or clarification.
