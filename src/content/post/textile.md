## Textile
What is Textile? It is a text-friendly tool for interface design that allows editing interface texts apart from Figma. No reason to interrupt designers anymore. Try for free.

## Who is this for? 
Are you a designer who wants to stop text irritating and dreams to delegate all these wordy tasks to anyone else?

Are you an author who likes to create strong words and sentences, but doubts in pictures and tires of too much color?

I do hope to help both of you :) with Textile: the first tool to manage — edit, discuss, translate, etc. — Figma texts apart from Figma itself.

- Translate your Figma project in different languages
- Change text and check if design is robust enough
- Do not worry about UX writer Figma skills
- Protect sensitive project — delegate writing only
- Focus on interface text and its patterns
- Copy/paste texts in your interface quickly
- Measure and plan author’s work in your project
- Do not pay for Figma license for your authors
