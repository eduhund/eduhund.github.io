## Origin 

[We have interactive courses](https://eduhund.gumroad.com/l/bosses?_gl=1*19igkme*_ga*MjA0NjQzODgwMS4xNzEyMjk5MjUw*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTcxMzM0MTk2Mi40LjEuMTcxMzM0MzU5OS4wLjAuMA)  (task books) in various areas: UX design, management, UX writing, marketing and much more. Their first versions were in Google Sheets and looked like this.

![Eddition](http://files.eduhund.com/Tabun/tables.png) 

When we launched the first task book on tables, two days after launch we found several fundamental errors in it. There were some typos, and in a couple of places points for completed tasks were calculated incorrectly. There were mistakes that could be corrected later, but there were also those that annoy students right now.

We went to fix them. There were just under a hundred students, so we thought we’d quickly fix everything. We corrected it, the students were happy, the night was very long and fun. We didn’t want more of this experience of manually correcting errors in each Google sheet. It needs to be automated.

And then [Eddition](https://script.google.com/a/macros/sobakapav.com/library/d/1OwaVl6r1f1dHlsVwDTY0Cfa1cmiM5iMn31rrMtY3rkHS6vTnMwvswSf0/3) was born. 

### Hwo are the users?

**Everyone who somehow intersects with Google Sheets in their work.**

### How Eddition works?

The script has [3 functions](https://script.google.com/a/macros/sobakapav.com/library/d/1OwaVl6r1f1dHlsVwDTY0Cfa1cmiM5iMn31rrMtY3rkHS6vTnMwvswSf0/3).

1. The ability to correct one specific cell.
2. Possibility to correct several cells.
3. Ability to insert your own formula into a cell.

### Eddition helps you to:

- save time;
- increase productivity;
- automate document creation.

### What problems Eddition solves:

- If you have an array of identical documents, Eddition will help you correct a systematic typo in all documents or make the same change (recolor a column, for example).

Eddition, as a script, can only change literal values, formatting, conditional formatting, and work with formulas. It can't work with pictures.
