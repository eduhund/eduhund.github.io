4. Disagree with us, or answerÂ ambiguously â€” do whatever is good for your studying experience.

### Three NOs
**No video**. Reading is a rare pleasure these days, so will you please read the text?

**No group tasks**. You are the boss. Believe us, the first skill you have to master is being alone.

**No right answers**. We respect your ideas and are positive it is time for you to believe in yourself.

## Yes, of Course
**Case-like tasks**. We prefer close to real-life small tasks to boring and wordy MBA ones.

**Three levels of clues**. From yes/no options to a couple of words and then to an extensive explanation. As many clues as we have managed to come up with.

**Take as many goes as you wish**. You can do the tasks over and over again. No restrictions.

**Check the deadline**. You have two months only, but we think you can manage things faster.
