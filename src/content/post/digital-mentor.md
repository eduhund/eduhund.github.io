# Digital Mentor for Team Leaders and Novice Managers
Boost your management mindset â€¢ 135 tasks in 9 topics ðŸ•“ Two months â€¢ Certificate of Accomplishment

## Origin 
! [We have interactive courses] (https://eduhund.gumroad.com/l/bosses?_gl=1*19igkme*_ga*MjA0NjQzODgwMS4xNzEyMjk5MjUw*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTcxMzM0MTk2Mi40LjEuMTcxMzM0MzU5OS4wLjAuMA) (task books) in various areas: UX design, management, UX writing, marketing and much more. Their first versions were in Google Sheets and looked like this.
![Super wide] (http://files@files.eduhund.com/Tabun/tables.png) 

During one of the launches we needed to make more than 100 copies of task books directly from the master copy with some modifications: student name, task book ID. And of course we met a problem. 

### Google does not allow you to make many copies of one table in one click. You can make one copy as many times as you like, but only one at a time, and only by hand. 

Just imagine, make 100 copies of Google tables. Our entire team did not sleep all night to have time to make the needed amount of task books. And then, rename all the copies according to studentsâ€™ information. 

In order to avoid a similar situation in subsequent launches, we made Tabunn. 

### Tabunn helps you to:
1. Save time and increase productivity and of course have some sleep at night
2. Automate document creation 

If you need to make several copies of one document and perhaps modify some part of the new copy, try Tabunn.
